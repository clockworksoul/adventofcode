# Advent of Code

My entries for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about), an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

If you're not familiar with the idea of an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar):

> An Advent calendar is a special calendar used to count the days of Advent in anticipation of Christmas. Advent calendars, especially those that are made to be reusable, tend to begin on December 1, although those that are produced for a specific year often include the last few days of November that are part of the liturgical season.

Don't expect anything amazing. I usually do it for like a week (tops) and lose interest.
